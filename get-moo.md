## Getting Moo

### Stable Version, from Maven
If you're using Maven, the simplest thing is to add Moo as a dependency to your project:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.codiform</groupId>
        <artifactId>moo-core</artifactId>
        <version>2.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

If you're not using Maven, you can download the .jar from the [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g:"com.codiform"%20AND%20a:"moo-core") anyway.

You may need or prefer `moo-mvel`; you can learn more about that on the Wiki. See [Getting Moo](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/Moo/wiki/Getting-Moo) and [Extensions](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/Moo/wiki/Extensions)

### Development Version, from GitHub

If you'd like to be on the bleeding edge, you can download the current source repository, either as [a big ZIP file](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/Moo/archive/master.zip) or you can clone the repository from GitHub and build it yourself using Maven:

```console
    $ git clone git://github.com/geoffreywiseman/Moo.git
```
