## Getting Moo

If you're using Maven, the simplest thing is to add Moo as a dependency to your project:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.codiform</groupId>
        <artifactId>moo</artifactId>
        <version>1.3</version>
    </dependency>
```

If you're not using Maven, you can download the .jar from the [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g:"com.codiform"%20AND%20a:"moo") anyway.

If you'd like to be on the bleeding edge, you can download the current source repository, either as [a big ZIP file](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/Moo/archive/master.zip) or you can clone the repository from GitHub and build it yourself using Maven:

```console
    $ git clone git://github.com/geoffreywiseman/Moo.git
```
