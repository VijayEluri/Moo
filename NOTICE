At the moment, all the code written and contributed to the project is written by Geoffrey Wiseman.  Assuming
that someone else wishes to contribute, the simplest way would be for them to perform a copyright attribution
to Geoffrey Wiseman, but if someone wishes to contribute and isn't anxious to go through copyright
attribution, I'm willing to discuss the matter.  Get in touch, and we'll figure it out.
