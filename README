Moo -- Mapping Objects to Objects

It's not uncommon to need to do some mapping from one object model to another, whether that's
data transfer objects, an anti-corruption layer, or something else.  Two projects I've been on
have written code similar to this, and I thought it was time to start re-using rather than
building from scratch.
