/**
 * A package to contain domain classes used by tests. These classes are usually shared between multiple tests
 * and thus, one should be careful not to modify them in a way that would work well for one test but not another.
 * 
 * When writing classes that are really best-suited to a single test, it's probably better to make these static 
 * inner classes.
